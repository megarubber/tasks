# Routine Task Manager
#### A simple project to schedule tasks in Vue.js 

This is a simple project using Vue CLI (Vue.js version 2). I put 2 versions of project: the first called _"development-v1"_ (version made by me without copying the original) and the second called _"course-project"_ (original version).

Basically, the project works like this:
To create a task, type in the entry bar and add by pressing the button beside. This, you will create a task, which can be removed by pressing the Close button or be checked, when clicking on the task.

To run this project, you need Vue CLI and Node.js.

## Project setup with hot-reloads
```
git clone (HTTPS or SSH)
cd tarefas
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

Both projects are with different CSS styles, so don't think it's "strange".

#### The 2 projects don't have the function of being a "decent" thing, just to learn :) ####
